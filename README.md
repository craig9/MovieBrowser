# MovieBrowser (And now - TV shows/episodes)

It's very beta, it even uses icons that are hardcoded to file paths that ubuntu gives me, 
so please don't complain about that kind of thing. ðŸ˜›

It assumes your files will be organised a certain way (which is obvious from the code),
but I can write more info here, if you want it.

My commit messages are not good, because I was tired and didn't think up descriptive
messages. So - the whole thing might be a waste of time, but anyway..
